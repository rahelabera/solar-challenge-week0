Notebooks and how to use them

This directory contains the project's analysis notebooks. They are designed for interactive exploration and visualization of solar datasets.

How to open
- Activate the project's virtual environment first:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- Open the notebooks in VS Code or run `jupyter lab` / `jupyter notebook` and open the `.ipynb` files in the `notebooks/` folder.

Notes / tips
- The notebooks expect the Python environment from `requirements.txt` to be installed.
